# Wine Quality Classifier using Decision Tree

This project builds a machine learning model to classify red wine quality into **Good** or **Bad** categories using a Decision Tree Classifier.

---

## Dataset

The model uses the [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality), specifically the red wine data.

- Features include physicochemical tests like acidity, pH, alcohol, etc.
- The target variable is simplified into binary classes:
  - Good (quality >= 7)
  - Bad (quality < 7)
